# AI Legal Assistant with CrewAI + RAG

Ever wished you had a super-smart paralegal that reads *all* the PDFs and answers your legal questions? **Agentic Paralegal** does just that — powered by AI agents, vector search, and OpenAI's GPT-4o.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- 🧠 **Reads PDFs** — Ingests and chunks legal documents
- 🔍 **Finds info fast** — Uses Chroma vector store to fetch relevant sections
- 📄 **Writes smart answers** — GPT-4o generates responses from the docs
- ✅ **Checks its work** — Evaluation agent reviews the answer
- ✨ **Cleans it up** — Editor makes it human-friendly

If it can’t find the answer in your docs? It Googles it for you (kinda — via Tavily Search)!
